# ShellCheck SARIF Analysis Action

A GitHub Action that generates SARIF analysis results by running ShellCheck on shell scripts
in your repository.

## Overview

This action utilizes ShellCheck (a third-party static analysis tool) to analyze shell scripts
and generates results in SARIF format. The SARIF output integrates with GitHub Code Scanning
to help track shell script quality and potential security issues.

## Features

- üîç Leverages ShellCheck for shell script analysis
- üìä Generates SARIF format output for GitHub Code Scanning
- üéØ Configurable file matching patterns
- ‚ö° Supports multiple shell dialects (Bash, POSIX, Dash, KSH, BusyBox)
- üîí Built-in integration with GitHub Security features

## Dependencies

This action depends on:
- [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) - A static analysis tool for shell scripts
- Python 3.13 (automatically set up by the action)
- SARIF tooling (automatically installed by the action)

## Usage

Add the following to your GitHub Actions workflow (most inputs are optional):

```yaml
- name: Run ShellCheck Analysis
  uses: reactive-firewall/shellcheck-scan@v1
  with:
    # Optional: Specify exact path to scan (advanced feature)
    # path: '${{ github.workspace }}/downloads/my-artifact.bash'
    
    # Optional: Custom glob pattern for matching files
    match: '**/*.{sh,bash,ksh}'
    
    # Optional: Set minimum severity level (style, info, warning, error)
    severity: 'warning'
    
    # Optional: Specify shell dialect (bash, sh, dash, ksh, busybox)
    shell-format: 'bash'
    
    # required
    publish-artifacts: true
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `path` | Exact file path to scan | No | Auto-detected |
| `match` | Glob pattern for matching files | No | `**/*.{bash,sh,command}` |
| `severity` | Minimum severity level | No | `style` |
| `shell-format` | Shell dialect to use | No | `AUTOMATIC` |
| `publish-artifacts` | Upload results as artifacts | No | `true` |

## Requirements

This action requires:
- GitHub Actions
- Required permissions:
  - `security-events: write` (for uploading SARIF results)
  - `contents: read` (for scanning repository contents)

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: ShellCheck Analysis

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  shellcheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: reactive-firewall/shellcheck-scan@v1
```

### Full Usege

```yaml
# .github/workflows/shellcheck.yml
---
name: shellcheck
on: [push, pull_request]

permissions: {}  # Setting default permissions to none for enhanced security

jobs:
  shellcheck:
    permissions:
      contents: read  # for actions/checkout to fetch code
      pull-requests: read  # to get PR metadata
      security-events: write  # for github/codeql-action/upload-sarif to upload SARIF results

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
          submodules: true
      - name: Shellcheck Scan
        uses: reactive-firewall/shellcheck-scan@v1
        with:  # optional arguments
          match: 'scripts/* **/*.sh'
          publish-artifacts: false
        if: ${{ success() }}
```

### Custom Configuration

```yaml
- uses: reactive-firewall/shellcheck-scan@v1
